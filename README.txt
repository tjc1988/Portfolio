	After Effects Project / After Effects assignment video export 2.mp4
	This is a an After Effects video that I made that was part of an assignment. I used Photoshop to extract
	the wolf and ghost from other images and exported them into After Effects. I also used Photoshop to
	create layers with the fence on the bottom left and the vegetation on the bottom right. The flicker effect
	of the pumpkins and the bats blinking were done by extracting each of those parts of the image in
	Photoshop and exporting them into After Effects and using key frames to have the brightness constantly
	changing on the pumpkins and made the brightness on the bat's eye switch off and on.

	Photoshop Projects / Creating-a-Composite-Autumn.jpg
	This is a image that I used Photoshop to edit. The forest is the original image. One of the runners was
	added in using the layer masking tool while the other runner and dog was added in by extracting them from
	other images using the magic selector / lasso tool and I added in the text also.

	Photoshop Projects / War-of-the-Galaxys.jpg
	This was a banner ad that I made for an assignment. The images of the space / air craft were all added in
