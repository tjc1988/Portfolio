After Effects Project / After Effects assignment video export 2.mp4
This is a an After Effects video that I made that was part of an assignment. I used Photoshop to extract
the wolf and ghost from other images and exported them into After Effects. I also used Photoshop to
create layers with the fence on the bottom left and the vegetation on the bottom right. The flicker effect
of the pumpkins and the bats blinking were done by extracting each of those parts of the image in
Photoshop and exporting them into After Effects and using key frames to have the brightness constantly
changing on the pumpkins and made the brightness on the bat's eye switch off and on.
